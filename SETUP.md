# Project Setup Guide

This project requires **Node.js** to run. Since it was not installed on your system, please follow these steps:

## 1. Install Node.js
1.  Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for Windows.
3.  Run the installer and follow the prompts (default settings are fine).
4.  **Restart your computer** (or at least restart your terminal/VS Code) after installation to ensure the `node` command is recognized.

## 2. Install Dependencies
Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal in this folder (`NyayaSetu-main`) and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Run the Project
To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should then be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
