                        You can register on the Nyaya Setu website, fill out the victim relief form, and provide basic details such as
                        your name, FIR number, contact information, and required documents.

                        No. You can apply fully online using Nyaya Setu. If you are from a remote or tribal area or cannot access a
                        smartphone, a field officer can help you submit your application.

                        <li>Identity proof (Aadhaar or alternative ID)</li>

                        If available, you can also fetch documents directly from DigiLocker instead of uploading them manually.

                    <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
                        Aadhaar is helpful for fast verification, but it is not mandatory. You can use alternative KYC documents or
                        assisted verification from a field officer.

                        You can track your application anytime by logging into your Nyaya Setu dashboard. You will also receive updates

                        Relief is provided in stages depending on the case status, investigation stage, and government guidelines.
